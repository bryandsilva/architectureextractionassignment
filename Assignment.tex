% 1) Copy/paste everything between \begin{document} and \end{document} 
% starting at \begin{titlepage} and paste this into another LaTeX file where you 
% want your title page.
% OR
% 2) Remove everything outside the \begin{titlepage} and \end{titlepage} and 
% move this file to the same directory as the LaTeX file you wish to add it to. 
% Then add \input{./title_page_1.tex} to your LaTeX file where you want your

\section{Finding a Software System}
We looked at the following software systems and games.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Kodi}: Kodi is an open source software media player and entertainment hub. This is available on atleast seven platforms. This was one of the first softwares we looked at and kept it as a contender

\item \textbf{Quake III}: The source code for Quake is challenging and interesting. However, there is almost no documentation for the same and hence we decided not to go ahead with this for now.

\item \textbf{GIMP}: GIMP is a cross platform image editor with an excellent community backing it up. We decided to extract the architecture for GIMP. We talk more about GIMP in the further sections.

\end{enumerate}

We also looked at Doom3, SuperTuxKart, Wordpress, TuxRunner and Linux but found GIMP to be the most interesting on to use for this assignment
\section{About GIMP}
Gimp was designed initially as a General image manipulation program. This was later changed to GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is free and openly available to retouch and edit images, convert image formats and more specialized tasks targeted towards image manipulation. GIMP provides an interface to handle simple graphics needs without learning advanced methods for image manipulation. GIMP is more user friendly as compared to other photoshop techniques and can be modified to fit your needs. And the best part about it is that it is free.
\section{Counting the lines of code}
\subsection{Count Lines of Code}
Count Lines of Code, abbreviated as CLOC is a software used to count comment lines, blank lines and physical lines of code\cite{gitid}. We used this software initially when we looked at what software system we need to pick. We can look at figure \ref{fig:clocgimp} for the output for GIMP.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{clocgimp.png}
\caption{\label{fig:clocgimp}CLOC output for GIMP}
\end{figure}
%LocMetrics
\subsection{LocMetrics}
LocMetrics\cite{locmetrics} is very similar to what CLOC does. We did find this software interesting because of how it visualized the output.

\section{Architecture Extraction Tool}
\section{Directory Structure}
We generated a butterfly diagram in figure \ref{fig:direc} for the directory structure. Using this and the documentation we did want to identify the main folder we would want to have a look at. We concluded that he app directory is the main directory that we are concerned about. It contains the source code for GIMP without any external tools or plugins. We would ideally ignore the modules, plugins and libraries for now and focus on the app directory.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{directorybutterfly.png}
\caption{\label{fig:direc}Directory Structure}
\end{figure}
So we did the same for the app folder in figure \ref{fig:appfolder}. It was easy to comprehend since GIMP is very well organized with a good community support and documentation. The app/core directory is the guts of the GIMP software. Looking at the documentation provided for GIMP, major changes that need to be made start here. With the goal of refactoring in mind, this is where we would start, keeping in mind that changing files here will have an avalanche effect, so we need to be prepared for big changes in other files depending on these.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=11cm,height=100cm,keepaspectratio]{appfolder.png}
\caption{\label{fig:appfolder}Directory Structure for app folder}
\end{figure}
\section{Entry Point}
\section{Build Process}
\section{Control Flow}
\section{Dependencies}
\section{Algorithms}
To find the underlying algorithms behind the operations performed on GIMP, the wiki for the same had a link to the algorithms used. We expected to find all the underlying algorithms here but encountered a problem. There was only one operation described here shown in figure \ref{fig:algorithm}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{algorithm.png}
\caption{\label{fig:algorithm}Documentation on operation algorithms}
\end{figure}

Since this is implemented in the gimpoperationflood.c, the best way to find the algorithms for the other operations performed would be to have a look at where this file is located.
 
The app/operations folder is where this file located. Looking at the other files in the folder, we got an idea of where to look incase we had to change or add any further operations. Since these operations are triggered using the GUI, changing something here would cause us to look at the UI elements to be updated as well.

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Tables and Figures}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. You can upload a figure (JPEG, PNG or PDF) using the files menu. To include it in your document, use the includegraphics command as in the code for Figure~\ref{fig:frog} below.
